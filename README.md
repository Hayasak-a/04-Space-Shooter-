# 04-Space-Shooter-
A simple space shooter in Godot.

WASD or arrow keys to move, left-click or spacebar to fire (and to restart the game after a loss.)

One point for each enemy ship destroyed. If an enemy ship makes it offscreen without being destroyed, you lose.

Other features: score display, starlight (stars are colorful in the name of being visually interesting over realism), two enemy types(one moves side to side, one is somewhat faster)
